# DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTON AND ELASTICSEARCH

# Introduction
This project was based in analize one data set in a faster way using elasticsearch to index all data. Why elasticsearch? **Elasticsearch** is a distributed, open source analytics and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. And the data set that we used was about taxis trips, then we needed to make graphs using geopoints by that reasons we must put it in applying indexation with Elasticsearch.

In the other hand, for the visualization, we made a heatmap to show the most frecuent places to pickup people and the same with dropoff. These maps can be filter in months or anual mode, but also we made an data visualization using **Tableau**
