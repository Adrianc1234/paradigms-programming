# DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTON AND ELASTICSEARCH

## Introduction
This project was based in analize one data set in a faster way using elasticsearch to index all data. Why elasticsearch? **Elasticsearch** is a distributed, open source analytics and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. And the data set that we used was about taxis trips, then we needed to make graphs using geopoints by that reasons we must put it in applying indexation with Elasticsearch.

In the other hand, for the visualization, we made a heatmap to show the most frecuent places to pickup people and the same with dropoff. These maps can be filter in months or anual mode, but also we made an data visualization using **Tableau**

**Define**
Data-driven projects should start by defining the problem they want to solve and their actions. It is at this stage that you ask questions and come up with the purposes of your project. In our case the question was: Where and in which month of the year the requests for taxis are more frequent? With this we solve a problem for many companies of taxi services, since many times they do not know how to create their travel plans and also do not know where to offer the services. By doing this analysis we obtain frequent places of applications and also destinations, so the company can know where to establish and also where to establish defined destinations.

As a second point you will also know in which month the trips are longer and with that same give warning about the gasoline expenses in those months, in the same way that month taxis are more requested.
